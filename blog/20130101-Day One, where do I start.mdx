So where does one start to learn how to code?  Searching online for courses seemed to show up too many options (and expensives ones too).  Maybe there could be 
something for me to use and test the waters out first?  With this thought in mind, I decided that starting with a textbook would be the best course of action.

I think one of my main mistakes at this point was to not enquire online with others on which language and what method to use.  Nowadays, there is a plethora of information online,
such as reddit, other people's blogs, colleges and universities having better packages courses that are more targets at the current job market, as well as coding bootcamps.

I probably wouldn't have started learning to code with C++, and would have rather gone with a different programming language such as Python or Javascript.
